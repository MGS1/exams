    \question[1] State Bayes Theorem
    \begin{solution}
        Let $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ be mutually exclusive and exhaustive
        events. Then for any other event $B$,
        $$P(B) = P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + \cdots + P(B|A_n)P(A_n)$$
    \end{solution}
    \question[1] Define when two events $A$ and $B$ are independent.
    \begin{solution}
        If $P(A|B) = P(A).$
    \end{solution}
    \question[1] Define a binomial experiment
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The experiment consists of a sequence of $n$ trials,
        where $n$ is fixed in advance of the experiment.
        \item The trials are identical, and each trial can result in
        one of the same two possible outcomes, which we denote by
        sucess (S) or failure (F).
        \item The trials are independent, so that the outcome on any 
        particular trial does not influence the outcome on any other
        trial.
        \item The probability of success is constant from trial to 
        trial; we denote this probability by $p$.   
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}

    \question[1] Define a normal distribution.
    \begin{solution}
        A continuous rv $X$ is said to have a normal distribution with
    parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ where $- \infty < \mu < \infty$ and
    $0 < \sigma$, if the pdf of $X$ is 
    $$f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} e^{
    -(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma)^2}.$$
    \end{solution}

    \question[1] Define a statistics.
    \begin{solution}
        A statistic is any quantity whose value can be calculated from
    sample data.
    \end{solution}

    \question[1] Define a random sample.
    \begin{solution}
        The rv's $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are said to form a simple
    random sample of size $n$ if
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The $X_i$'s are independent rv's. 
    \item Every $X_i$ has the same probability distribution.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}


    \question[1] State the Central Limit Theorem
    \begin{solution}
        Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a random sample from a
    distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. THen if $n$
    is sufficiently large, $\bar{X}$ has approximately a normal
    distribution with $\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu$ and $\sigma_{\bar{X}}^2
    = \sigma^2/n$, and $T_0 = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$ also has
    approximately a normal distribution with $\mu_{T_0} = n\mu$,
    $\sigma_{T_0}^2 = n\sigma^2$. THe large the value of $n$, the
    better the approximation.

    \question[4] Consider tossing a fair dice and let $A = \{2, 4,
    6\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $C = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.$ 
    \begin{parts}
    \part[2] Are $A$ and $B$ independent?
    \begin{solution}
      No: $P(A|B) = \frac{1}{3}$ while $P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$.
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] Are $A$ and $C$ independent?
    \begin{solution}
      Yes: $P(A|C) = \frac{1}{2} = P(A)$
    \end{solution}
    \end{parts}

    \question[2] If $X \sim \operatorname{Bin}(n, p),$ then what are
    $E(X)$, $V(X)$ and $\sigma_X$? What if $X$ is Poisson?
    \begin{solution}
        $$E(X) = np$$
        $$V(X) = np(1-p)$$
        $$\sigma_X = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$$

    \question[2] Extensive experience with fans of a certain type used
    in diesel engines has suggested that the exponential distribution
    provides a good model for time until failure. If the mean time
    between failure is 25000, What is the pdf for
    this distribution?  
    \begin{solution}

    % Devore 7.1.4a
    
    \question[2] On the basis of extensive tests, the yield point of a
    particular type of mild steel-reinforcing bar is known to be
    normally distributed with $\sigma = 100$. The composition of the
    bar has been slightly modified, but the modification is not
    believed to have affected either the normality or the value of
    $\sigma$. If a sample of 25 modified bars resulted in a sample
    average yield point of 8439 lb, compute a 90\% CI for the true
    average yield point of the modified bar.

    \begin{solution}
        $$8406.2 \pm 1.6 \cdot \frac{100}{\sqrt{25}} = [8406.2,
        8471.8]$$
    \end{solution}

    % Devore 7.2.15

    \question[3] In a survey of 277 randomly selected adult female
    shoppers, 69 stated that whenever an advertised item is
    unavailable at their local supermarket, they request a
    raincheck. Obtain a 99\% CI for the true proportion $p$ of adult
    female shoppers who request a raincheck in such situations.

    \begin{solution}
    
        $$.249 \pm 2.55 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{.249} \cdot .251}{277} =
        [.182, .316]$$

    \end{solution}

    % Devore 7.3.24

    \question[2] A triathlon consisting of swimming, cycling, and
    running is one of the more strenuous amateur sporting events. A
    paper reports on a study involving nine male triathletes. Maximum
    heart rate (beats/min) was recorded during performance of each of
    the three events. For swimming, the sample mean and sample
    standard deviation were 188.0 7.2, respectively. Assuming that the
    heart rate distribution is (approximately) normal, construct a
    98\% CI for true mean heart rate of triathletes while swimming.

    \begin{solution}

        $$\alpha = 2, \tau_{.01, 8} = 2.896$$
        $$1880 \pm 2.896 \cdot \frac{22}{\sqrt{3}} = [181.05,
        194.95]$$

    \end{solution}

    % Devore 8.3.37

    \question[2] An article discusses the court case {\it Swain
    v. Alabama} (1965), in which it was alleged that there was
    discrimination against blacks in grand jury selection. Census data
    suggested that 25\% of those eligible for grand jury service were
    black, yet a random sample of 1050 called to appear for possible
    duty yielded only 177 blacks. Using a level .01 test, does this
    data argue strongly for a conclusion of discrimination?

    \begin{solution}

        $$z = \frac{\frac{177}{1050} - .25}{\sqrt{.25 \cdot 75/2050}}
        = -6.09 \le -2.33$$

        So yes.

    \end{solution}

    % 8.4.50

    \question[3] Because of variability in the manufactoring process,
    the actual yielding point of a sample of mild steel subjected to
    increasing stress will usually differ from the theoretical
    yielding point. Let $p$ denote the true proportion of samples that
    yield before their theoretical yielding point. If on the basis of
    a sample it can be concluded that more than 20\% of all specimens
    yield before the theoretical point, the production process will
    have to be modified. If 15 of 60 specimens yield before the
    theoretical point, what is the $P$-value when the appropriate test
    is used, and what would you advise the company to do?

    \begin{solution}

        No modification is necessary.

    \end{solution}

    \question[2] Are male college students more easily bored than
    their female counterparts? A study administered a scale to 97 male
    and 148 female U.S. college students. Does the following data
    support that Boredom is higher for men than for women? Test the
    appropriate hypothesis using a .05 significance level.

        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \begin{solution}

        $$z = 1.83 > z_\alpha = 1.645$$
        
        Supports the claim.

    \question[2] Suppose $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are true mean stopping
    distances at 50 mph for cars of a certain type equipped with two
    different types of braking systems. Use the pooled $t$ test at
    significance level .01 to test $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = -10$ versus
    $H_\alpha : \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne -10$ for the following data: $m =
    6$, $\bar{x} = 115.7$, $s_1 = 5.03$, $n = 6$, $\bar{y} = 129.3$,
    and $s_2 = 5.38$.

    \begin{solution}

        $$t = \frac{115.7 - 128.3 + 10}{(\sqrt{\frac{6 \cdot 5.03^2 +
        6 \cdot 5.38^2}{10}})(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}})}$$
        $$ = -1.093$$
        $$t_{-1, 10} = 2.764$$

        So accept $H_0$

    \question[2] Consider the accompanying data on breaking load
    (kg/25 mm width) for various fabrics in both an unabraded
    condition and an abraded condition. Use the paired $t$ test to
    test $H_0 : \mu_D = 0$ versus $H_\alpha : \mu_D > 0$ at
    significance level .01.

          $$\bar{x_D} = 7.25$$
          $$S_D = 11.86$$
          $$t = \frac{7.25 - 0}{11.86\sqrt{8}} = 1.73$$
          $$t_{.01, 7} = 2.998$$

    \question[2] Consider regressing $y = 28$-day standard-cured
    strength (psi) against $x = $ accelerated strength (psi). Suppose
    the equation of the true regression line is $y = 1800 +
    1.3x$. Suppose the standard deviation is $\epsilon = 350$

    strength will exceed 5000 psi when the value of accelerated
    strength is 2000?

    \begin{solution}

        $$E(X = 2000) = 4400$$
        $$5000 - 4400 = 600 = 1.714$$
        $$P(y \ge 5000) = 1 - \Phi(1.714) = .0436$$

    = 15, \sum x = 860, \sum y = 348, \sum x^2 = 56,700, \sum y^2 =
    8954$ and $\sum xy = 22,265$.

    \begin{solution}

        $$r = (15 \cdot 22265 - 860 \cdot 348)/\sqrt{(15 \cdot 56700 -
        860^2)(15 \cdot 8954 - 348^2)} = .9066$$

        $$T = .9066 \sqrt{13}/\sqrt{1 - .9066^2} = 7.746$$
