  \section{Discrete Charge Distributions}
  
  % 18.39
  \question[8] An electric dipole consists of a positive charge $q$ on
  the $x$ axis at $x = a$ and a negative charge $-q$ on the $x$ axis
  at $x = -a$. Find the magnitude and direction of the electric field
  at a point $y$ on the $y$ axis, and show that for $y >> a$, the
  field is approximately ${\bf E} = -(kp/y^3){\bf i}$, where $p$ is
  the magnitude of the dipole moment.

  \begin{solution}
    The force on the point only exists in the $x$ direction by
    symmetry. But the $x$ components are in direction of $-{\bf i}$.

    So,
    $$F_{net} = -\frac{2kq\ dq}{y^2 + a^2} \cdot \cos \theta {\bf i}
    = \frac{-2kq\  dq}{y^2+a^2}\frac{a}{\sqrt{y^2 + a^2}} {\bf i}$$

    Therefore
    $${\bf E} = \frac{ {\bf F} }{ dq } = - \frac{kp}{ (y^2+a^2)^{3/2}
    } {\bf i}$$

    If $y >> a$ then $(y^2 + a^2)^{3/2} \approx y^3$.
    So if $y >> a$, then ${\bf E} \approx - \frac{kp}{y^3} {\bf i}$.
  \end{solution}

  \section{Continuous Charge Distributions}

  % Example on page 637 of 19-3
  \question[8] Use Gauss' law to compute the electric field near an
  infinite line charge.

  \begin{solution}
    Consider a cyclinder of length $L$ and radius $r$ with uniform
    charge density $\lambda$,
    $$\phi_{net} = \int E_n dA = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{inside}$$
    And,
    $$\int E_n dA = E_r \int dA = \frac{\lambda L}{\epsilon_0}$$
    The area of the cyclindrical surface is $2\pi r L$,
    $$E_r 2\pi r L = \frac{\lambda L}{\epsilon_0}$$
    $$E_r = \frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\lambda}{r} = 2k \frac{\lambda}{r}$$
  \end{solution}

    $$\sigma = 2.66 \times 10^{-5}$$
    $$Q = 4\pi r^2 \sigma = 8.55 \mu C$$
  \end{solution}

  % 20.21
  \question[2] If $V(x) = 2000 + 3000x$ where $V$ is in volts and $x$
  is in meters, what is $E_x$?

  \begin{solution}
    $$-3000 V/m$$
  \end{solution}

  % 20.13
  \question[2] Point charges $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are at the
  corners of an equilateral triangle of side 2.5 m. Find the
  electrostatic potential energy of this charge distribution if $(q_1
  = q_2 = q_3 = 4.2 \mu C)$.

  % 21.10
  \question[3] A $3-\mu F$ capacitor is charged to 100 V. How much
  energy did it take to bring this capacitor to this charge level?

  \begin{solution}
    $$E = \frac{1}{2}C V^2 = 0.015 J$$
  \end{solution}

  \question (\totalpoints\ points) A parallel-plate capacitor of plate
  area $A$ and separation $x$ is given a charge $Q$ and is then
  removed from the charging source. 
  \begin{parts}
    \part[2] Find the stored electrostatic energy as a function of
    $x$.
    \begin{solution}
      $$C = \epsilon_0 A/x$$
      $$U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{x}{\epsilon_0 A} Q^2$$
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] Find the increase in energy $dU$ due to an increase in
    plate separation $dx$ from $dU = (dU/dx) dx$. 
    \begin{solution}
      $$\frac{dU}{dx} = \frac{Q^2}{2\epsilon_0 A}$$
      $$dU = \frac{Q^2}{2\epsilon_0 A} dx$$
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] If $F$ is the force exerted by one plate on the other,
    the work needed to move one plate a distance $dx$ is $F dx =
    dU$. Show that $F = Q^2/2\epsilon_0 A$.
    \begin{solution}
      $$F = \frac{dU}{dx} = \frac{Q^2}{2\epsilon_0 A}$$
    \end{solution}
    \part[3] Show that the force in part (c) equals $\frac{1}{2} EQ$
    where $Q$ is the charge on one plate and $E$ is the electric field
    between the plates. Discuss the reason for the factor of
    $\frac{1}{2}$ in this.
    \begin{solution}
      $$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{A\epsilon_0}$$
      So $\frac{1}{2} EQ^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2A\epsilon_0} = F$. 
      
      Why? Force on a plate $= \int_0^L E \sigma dx =
      \frac{\sigma^2}{2\epsilon_0} A = \frac{Q^2}{2A\epsilon_0}$. The
      $E$ in this integral is due to the other plate. 

      The net field in the plate is zero, the charges don't act on
      themsleves, so only the electric field of the other plate needs
      to be considered.
    \end{solution}
