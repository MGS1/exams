    position when it is 10.0 m down range from its starting
    position?

    Yes.

  \section{Force}
  
  \question[2] A 5 kg concrete block is lowered with a downward

  block on the rope is:

    \choice 35 N up
    \CorrectChoice 35 N down
    \choice 49 N up
  \end{oneparchoices}
  
  \question[2] The ``reaction'' force does not cancel the ``action''
  force beacuse:
  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice action force is greater
    \CorrectChoice they act on different bodies
    \choice they are in the same direction
    \choice the reaction force exists only after the action force is
    removed
    \choice reaction force is greater than the action force
  \end{oneparchoices}
  
  \question[2] A block slides down a frictionless plane which makes
  an angle of $30^\circ$ with the horizontal. The acceleration of
  the block (in cm/s$^2$) is:
  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice 980
    \choice 566
    \choice 849
    \choice zero
    \CorrectChoice 490
  \end{oneparchoices}
  
  \question[2] A 1000 kg elevator is rising and its speed is
  increasing at 3 m/s$^2$. The tension in the elevator cable is:
  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice 6800 N
    \choice 1000 N
    \choice 3000 N
    \choice 9800 N
    \CorrectChoice 12800 N
  \end{oneparchoices}
  
  \section{Force and Friction}
  
  \question[2] A box rests on a rough board 10 meters long. When one
  end of the board is slowly raised to a height of 6 meters above the
  other end, the box begins to slide. The coefficient of static
  friction is:
  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice 0.8
    \choice 0.25
    \choice 0.4
    \choice 0.6
    \CorrectChoice 0.75
  \end{oneparchoices}

  \question[2] A horizontal force of 12 N pushes a 0.50 kg block
  against a vertical wall. The block is initially at rest. If $\mu_s =
  0.6$ and $\mu_k = 0.80$, the acceleration of the block in m/s$^2$
  is:
  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \CorrectChoice 0
    \choice 9.4
    \choice 9.8
    \choice 14.4
    \choice 19.2
  \end{oneparchoices}

  \question[2] Why do raindrops fall with constant speed during the
  later stages of their descent?
  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice the gravitational force is the same for all drops
    \CorrectChoice air resistance just balances the force of gravity
    \choice the drops all fall from the same height
    \choice the force of gravity is negligible for objects as small as
    raindrops
    \choice gravity cannot increase the speed of a falling object to
    more than 32 ft/s.
  \end{oneparchoices}

  \question (\totalpoints\ points) A man drags a 80 kg crate across a
  floor by pulling a rope that makes an angle of 15$^\circ$ above the
  horizontal.
  \begin{parts}
    \part[5] If the coefficient of static friction is 0.50 what force
    must the man exert to start the crate moving.
    \begin{solution}
      $$F = f/\cos \theta = \frac{0.50 N}{\cos \theta} = \frac{0.50
        (mg - F_m \sin \theta)}{\cos \theta}$$
      $$F + \frac{0.5F \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{0.5 mg}{\cos
        \theta}$$
      $$F = \frac{0.5 mg}{\cos \theta (1 + 0.5 \tan \theta)}$$
      $$= 357.89 N$$
    \end{solution}
    \part[5] If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.35 what is
    the acceleration of the crate just after it starts moving while
    the man is still exerting the force of part (a)?
    \begin{solution}
      $$a = 1.3 m/s^2$$
    \end{solution}

  \section{Work and Energy}

    the beginning of the 3.0 m section? {\bf Use the work-energy
      theorem.}
